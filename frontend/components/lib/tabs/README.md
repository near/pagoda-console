# Tabs

Implemented via Radix primitives: https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/tabs

There are two ways you can implement tabs: with a trigger or controlled by state.

_If the current props and Stitches style overrides aren't enough to cover your use case, feel free to implement your own component using the Radix primitives directly._

## Routing

TODO: Need to figure out how the tabs will work with routing.
