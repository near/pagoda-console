# NFT Zero to Hero

> In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
> You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro#installing-the-rust-toolchain)
- [A NEAR Wallet](#near-account)
- [NEAR-CLI](/docs/tools/near-cli#setup)

<Info>
**NEW TO RUST?**

If you are new to Rust and want to dive into smart contract development, our [Quick-start guide](/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro) is a great place to start.
