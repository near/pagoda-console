NestJS API for the NEAR developer console

## Database

Initialize database with Prisma models
```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Wipe the contents of the database
```
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### Update models

Whenever models are changed, a new Prisma client must be generated
```
npx prisma generate
```

> The `prisma generate` command reads your Prisma schema and updates the generated Prisma Client library inside `node_modules/@prisma/client`.
